# Event Management Project (Backend + Frontend)

This archive contains a minimal full-stack event management project:
- `event-management-backend` - NestJS + Prisma REST API
- `event-management-frontend` - Next.js + Tailwind frontend

Instructions:
- Each folder contains a `.env.sample` file â€” copy to `.env` / `.env.local` and adjust.
- Backend expects PostgreSQL and Prisma.
- See earlier assistant messages for full run instructions.
